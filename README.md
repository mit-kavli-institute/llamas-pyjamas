# LlamasPipeline

This repository contains Data Reduction Pipeline tools for the LLAMAS Integral Field Spectrometer

It is being updated frequently as the instrument comes online.

THIS IS AN IN-PROGRESS DEVELOPMENT PIPELINE.  IT IS MADE AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC IN READ-ONLY FORMAT
FOR OBSERVATION PLANNING AND EXECUTION BUT NO WARRANY IS MADE REGARDING INSTALLATION OR 
EXECUTION UNTIL INSTRUMENT COMMISSIONING IS COMPLETE.

Users of this pipeline are requested to cite Hughes et al. (in prep).

For instructions on installation, compilation, and runtime, please see files in the Tutorials directory.

### Auxillary Files

To currently run the pipeline, please download the mastercalib folder from this location and have the folder located within the llamas_pyjamas subfolder: https://mit-kavli.box.com/s/sbgfzlse3kjma0vakybhm2wbovi29klm

You will also need to download the combined_bias.fits file and keep a copy within both llamas_pyjamas and the Bias subfolder to run the GUI.

### Demo files
To test run the pipelines on data, we have provided a standard star raw image, flat field images, and a bias image to create an extracted WhiteLight image. https://mit-kavli.box.com/s/k7s3bmwu98q3iljm4djpzidxj7qg26cl
